# Cards without remediation guidance

This index lists every issue card emitted by the analyzer scripts that omits the `-Remediation` parameter.
Use it to prioritize backlog work by jumping directly to the PowerShell call site for each remediation gap.
Dynamic titles appear exactly as authored (including format strings or variables) so reviewers can evaluate context before adding guidance.
The table is sorted by file path to mirror the repository layout.
