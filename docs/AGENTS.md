# Repository-wide agent instructions

- Every issue card emitted by analyzers or report components must include a single, plain-English sentence summarizing the real-world impact for technicians or end users. Keep this line concise (one sentence) and ensure it clearly conveys the consequence of the issue.
- When editing heuristics, analyzers, or report templates, verify that any new or updated issue cards follow this plain-English explanation requirement. If the collected data cannot supply enough context, note that in the explanation.
- Refer to the "Issue card authoring conventions" section of `README.md` for additional background.
