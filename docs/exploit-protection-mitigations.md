# Exploit protection mitigation heuristic

The security analyzer reads the system-wide process mitigation policy from the
`exploit-protection` artifact, which is collected by running
`Get-ProcessMitigation -System`. The payload exposes whether Control Flow Guard
(CFG), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), and mandatory Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) are enabled across the device.

The "Exploit protection mitigations not fully enabled" issue is raised with
medium severity whenever any of these global mitigations is reported as disabled
or left unset. The evidence section lists each field (`CFG.Enable`,
`DEP.Enable`, `ASLR.Enable`) so technicians can see which settings returned `0`
(disabled), `1` (enabled), or `$null` (unknown). When all three mitigations
return `1`, the analyzer instead records a normal stating that exploit
protection is enforced.

If the card appears with all three values at `0`, it means the device is running
without CFG, DEP, or ASLR hardening. That configuration leaves memory-corruption
exploits significantly easier to weaponize because common defenses against
code-reuse or malicious payload injection are absent.

To remediate the warning, enable exploit protection system settings through the
Windows Security app (App & browser control → Exploit protection → System
settings) or deploy a `Set-ProcessMitigation -System` policy that turns on CFG,
DEP (AlwaysOn), and ASLR (ForceRelocateImages). After applying the policy, reboot
or log off affected devices so the mitigations take effect.
